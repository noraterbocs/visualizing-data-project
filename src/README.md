# Project Avocado Sales API
The goal of this project is to visualize the avocado sales RESTful API that I have built in this backend project: https://github.com/noraterbocs/project-express-api
The API provides data for avocado sales in the US.
It was built using
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Swagger for API documentation. To access the documentation, go to https://project-express-api-cpxm366faa-lz.a.run.app/api-docs/

Endpoints:
GET
/sales
Get all avocado sales data

GET
/sales/{id}
Get specific avocado sales data

GET
/sales/region/{region}
Get all sales data for specific region

GET
/sales/date/{date}
Get all sales data on a specific date

GET
/sales/salesRanking/results
Get the highest and lowest sales volume

The frontend of the project was built using React and React Styled Components.
